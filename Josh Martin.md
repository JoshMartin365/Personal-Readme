About me:
I’ve been very fortunate to have a few wonderful mentors in my life. I am open to constructive criticism and am eager to learn new things.  I was a painfully shy person until I started  my career in HR and recruiting. I’ve always had an interest in programming, primary driven by my love for gaming, and decided to quit the recruiting industry to pursue programming.
